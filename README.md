## Tech Challenges

Weekly coding challenges.<br/>
Enter your submission by creating a pull request on _master_ for the given week's coding challenge.

### Submitting Your Solution

To submit your solution to a challenge, create a branch with your GitHub username,
followed by a _forward slash_ and the name of the challenge (e.g. `mygithubusername/reverse-string`).<br/>
Then submit a pull request.

Submitting a PR will run the tests in GitHub Actions.<br/>
The tests are encrypted as an `.asc` file so as not to give away the nuances of the challenge.<br/>
The tests will be decrypted in GitHub Actions and run against your solution on opening of a PR.<br/>
Writing your own tests may help you solve the challenges but is not a necessity to enter.<br/>

One winner will be selected for each challenge based on the most efficient solution (order of time and space). 
Other factors will be taken into account, such as code readability, date of submission etc.   
If two solutions of equal calibre are submitted, the first one to have been submitted will be chosen as the winner.

### Leaderboard & Scoring System
A leaderboard will be kept over the course of the challenges.<br/>
The point system is as follows

**Submission with at least 1 test passing:** `1 point`<br/>
**Submission with all tests passing:** `2 points`<br/>
**Submission selected as the challenge winner:** `3 points`<br/>
